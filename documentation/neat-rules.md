# NEAT rules

### Encoding the genome

NEATâ€™s genetic encoding scheme is designed to allow corresponding genes to be easily
lined up when two genomes cross over during mating. Genomes are linear represen-
tations of network connectivity (Figure 2). Each genome includes a list of connection
genes, each of which refers to two node genes being connected. Node genes provide a
list of inputs, hidden nodes, and outputs that can be connected. Each connection gene
specifies the in-node, the out-node, the weight of the connection, whether or not the
connection gene is expressed (an enable bit), and an innovation number, which allows
finding corresponding genes (as will be explained below).
