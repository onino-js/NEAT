# GLOSSARY

### NEAT

The acronyme for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies. A specific class of genetic algorithm.

### Phenotype

A phenotype is an individual of a population. In the case of a NEAT, an individual or phenoyupe is a neural network that can be feed with inputs to produce outputs in order to solve practical problems.

### Genotype or Genome

A Genome is a representation of a phenotype, which is an individual over a population. All individuals that share the same genome behave exactly the same. This representation can be done in many ways.In the case of a neat implementation, the encoding rules are described in [Encoding the genome](#encoding-the-genome).

### Neuron or Node

Represent a node of a neural network.

### Neuron gene or Node gene

A Neuron gene is an encoded representation of a Neuron (or Node).

### Axon or Connexion

### Axon gene or Connexion gene

### Species

A Species is a collection of Phenotypes that are compatible. The compatibility has a functional definition given in https://github.com/onino-js/NEAT/blob/main/documentation/neat-implementation.md

### Mutation

### Speciation

### Epoch

### Fitness

### Distance
