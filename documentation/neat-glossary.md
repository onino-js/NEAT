# GLOSSARY

### NEAT

### Genotype or Genome

A Genome is a representation of a phenotype, which is an individual over a population. In the case of a NEAT, an individual is a neural network that can be feed with inputs to produce outputs in order to solve practical problems. All individuals that share the same genome behave exactly the same. This representation can be done in many ways.In the case of a neat implementation, the encoding rules are described in [Encoding the genome](#encoding-the-genome).
