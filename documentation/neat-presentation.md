# NEAT presentation

Here we describe very quickly what a Neat is, where does it comes from and when it can be suitable to sovle problems. To have more detailed informations plpease read the related scientific articles.

## Genetic algorithms

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

It basically implements 3 computing steps over a collection of objects called genomes:

1. Selection
2. Mutation
3. Crossovers

The diagram below gives a good representation of the process:

Genetic algorithms do not scale well with complexity.
GAs have a tendency to converge towards local optima or even arbitrary points rather than the global optimum of the problem.
